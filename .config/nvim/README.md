# Sorting out plugins
- comment -  I used this one to press `gc` to comment some lines. But I wanna try to use more the default way of commenting lines out with visual block
- vim-visual-multi - In the same spirit I wanna use the native capabilities for this. Most of the time visual block is enough or Macros otherwise
- csvview - I use it not often at all and I think it doesnt justify an extra dependency. I could probably print the csv nice with columns unix command 
- lsplinks -  I used it quite a bit while working with openapi specs but I dont use it anymore
- vim-bundler and vim-endwise - part of my ruby setup but dont need them anymore
- which-key - Lets see how it goes without it. I actually dont usually need it 
- gitsigns - actually cool so I might re add it. but for now I have all needed functionality with vim-fugitive.
- autopairs - I removed them because I wanna use more of the  native stuff
- markview - seeing raw markdown sometimes is easier to edit. Wanna try for some time without this plugin
